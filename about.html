      <p>I am seeking a SE1 position where I can contribute to a team and work with other developers who can help me broaden and advance my coding skills.</p> 

      <p>My development background is nontraditional, as I am a recent graduate of The Iron Yard, Atlanta, where I completed an immersive boot camp in Ruby on Rails web development. It was challenging, but absolutely enjoyable!  I had always wanted to pursue software/web development, and I decided that it was time to 'take the leap'. I am passionate about learning the tools and technologies that will allow me to continue to design innovative, creative, and useful web applications.</p>

  		<p>I have demonstrated, practical Ruby on Rails experience while going through the daily instruction and practice at The Iron Yard.  A summary/index of the evolution of my development experience is <a href="http://evankoch.com/apps/">here: My Projects/Apps</a>.  While at The Iron Yard I was also on the winning team at the organization’s internal Hackathon, sponsored by SolTech Atlanta, where I worked with a four-person design team to build the winning app. </p>

  		<p>I’m excited to continue my learning trajectory by expanding my skill set to be a dependable resource as a Ruby on Rails engineer.  I look forward to talking with you to discuss my candidacy for a junior SE1 position, and how I can be a great addition to your development team.</p>

  		<p>Until then, if you have any questions, please reach out!</p>
