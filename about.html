		<p>I am seeking a SE1 position where I can contribute to a team and work with other developers who can help me broaden and advance my coding skills.  I am passionate about learning the tools and technologies that will allow me to design innovative, creative, and useful web applications.  I would love the opportunity to work on creative projects with a team that is equally passionate about turning creative ideas into innovative web applications.</p>

		<p>My development background is nontraditional, as I am a recent graduate of The Iron Yard, Atlanta, where I completed an immersive, practical web development course in Ruby on Rails Engineering.  It was challenging, but absolutely enjoyable.  This career shift represents a change from my previous path in information technology and business systems/sales.  I have always been an adept computer ‘user’, but my passion lies with the ability to CREATE the tools, applications that others can use.</p>

		<p>I have demonstrated Ruby on Rails experience while going through the daily instruction and practice at The Iron Yard.  A summary/index of the evolution of my development experience is <a href="http://evo21.github.io/apps/">here: My Projects/Apps</a>.  While at The Iron Yard I was also on the winning team at the organization’s internal Hackathon, sponsored by SolTech Atlanta, where I worked with a four-person design team to build the winning app.  I’m excited to continue my learning trajectory by expanding my skill set to be a dependable resource as a Ruby on Rails engineer with your design team.</p>

		<p>I look forward to talking with you to discuss my candidacy for a junior position with you company, and how I can help create the best product and provide the best support to your clients.</p>

		<p>Until then, if you have any questions, please email or call me at the contact info below—I welcome the chance to discuss how I can be a great addition to your team!</p>
